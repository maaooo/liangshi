About
=====

`Nikhil Marathe <http://nikhilism.com>`_ started writing this book one
afternoon (June 16, 2012) when he didn't feel like programming. He had recently
been stung by the lack of good documentation on libuv while working on
`node-taglib <https://github.com/nikhilm/node-taglib>`_. Although reference
documentation was present, there were no comprehensive tutorials. This book is
the output of that need and tries to be accurate. That said, Nikhil is young
and inexperienced and may be severely wrong at points. He encourages you to
`call him out <nsm.nikhil@gmail.com>`_ if you find an error. You can contribute
to the book by `forking the repository <https://github.com/nikhilm/uvbook>`_
and sending a pull request.

Nikhil is indebted to Marc Lehmann's comprehensive `man page
<http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod>`_ about libev which
describes much of the semantics of the two libraries.

This book was made using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ and `vim
<http://www.vim.org>`_.
